# Calculator App
[A work in progress]*

- This is a simple calculator app I've built that is able to add, subtract, multiply and divide integers and decimal numbers
- Built in Android Studio using Jetpack Compose, MVVM and Kotlin

*TODO List: 
- Make Calculation and Result numbers in text value not overlap on new column when numbers exceed character limit on one line
- Chain multiple operations to calculate a single result
- Fix state.number2 so second number can display and apply decimal point to calculations correctly
